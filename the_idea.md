idea: a cozy fishing \& driving game about (of course) fishing and exploration



weather: fog, snow, rain, storms, wind

atmosphere: golden sunset, dark nights, foggy mornings, night sky

artstyle: realistic, cold, retro style, low poly

vibes: cold and raw, but insulation from the cold is the cozy vibe

creatures: birds, fishes under the ice, wolves howling, deers, bunnies, crows, bats



gameplay: major in fishing, secondary delivery and selling fishies to get upgrades, driving not required (stay in a little town forever)

driving: realistic, road signs, mountain road, highway, also the only car on the road for simplicity

fishing: ice fishing, river, beach, lake, cave fishing (maybe)

feed things: birds, ducks 



world: big, maybe island, volcano shape, valley

places: beachside, snowy peaks, lakeside, maybe more

infrastructure: cold, soviet-era apartments in beach cities. warm, small cottages by lakeside and snowy peaks, lighthouses, radio towers, abandoned places

day/night: 4 or 6 hours (could go 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours)

notes: although soviet-era apartments would better fit snowy vibes, perhaps not so much summer nights?



npc: simple interactions, more worldbuilding than character development, but could have charming personalities

story: not much

secrets: if time allows, secret fishes, cave fishing
